Hey,
So I'm me. That's who I am. Me has been programming for 17 years. But I am has no formal programming education. Therefor, yo, myself, is like a top-level mobster: great with guns, but still worse than the lowest level soldier.

So I'm looking for a little code critique. Tear it away. I already know I suck, I want to know what specifically I suck at and some resources to learn how to not suck at it. 

So here's the deal -- I'm watching the GD50 Breakout lecture. Lua, Love2D. 1/3 the way in, some student asks about using sprite sheets to animate. Well, guess who's an idiot? I AM, so I dive straight into re-inventing the wheel and spend 6 hours programming an animator class, utility library, and implementing it all, then spend 2.5 hours fixing graphical issues.

Hence: Me, I, Yo, Myself == Idiot or dum-dum. 
I've got lots of experience in Python and C#, and quite a bit in C++, and Lua is breaking my brainy-bits. 

So I was wondering if y'all could look over my Breakout animator code and all that it involves. It's bad, I know. I apologize. 

I have no clue how to use GitHub, but I guess I'll figure it out before I press Enter here. 


Edit #1: deleted unecessary Paddle code.
